# DEPRECATED: Delegation Orchestrator Agent

**This agent has been deprecated.** Its functionality has been merged into the `task-planner` skill.

## Migration Guide

The `task-planner` skill now handles:
- Task decomposition and analysis
- Agent selection via keyword matching
- Wave assignment for parallel/sequential execution
- TodoWrite population
- Execution plan JSON generation

## Previous Functionality (for reference)

This agent previously:
1. Consumed task-planner output
2. Mapped subtasks to specialized agents via keyword analysis
3. Generated JSON execution plans with wave structure
4. Created TodoWrite entries for progress tracking

All of this is now done directly by the `task-planner` skill, eliminating the need for a separate orchestration step.

## Removal Timeline

This file is kept for reference during the transition period. It will be removed in a future version.
