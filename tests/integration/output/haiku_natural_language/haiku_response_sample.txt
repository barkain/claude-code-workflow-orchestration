VALIDATION DECISION: CONTINUE

The subagent has successfully completed the task objective. The deliverables include:

1. **Function Implementation**: An `add()` function that accepts two numeric parameters and returns their sum, directly addressing the core requirement.

2. **Input Validation**: The function includes validation to ensure both parameters are numbers, which is a best practice that prevents runtime errors.

3. **Documentation**: Docstring documentation has been added, making the function's usage clear to other developers.

The implementation meets all stated requirements for this phase. There are no critical gaps or issues that would prevent proceeding to the next phase. The work is complete and ready for continuation.
