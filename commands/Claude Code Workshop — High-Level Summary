# Claude Code Workshop — High-Level Summary

**Date:** July 9, 2025  
**Presenter:** Nadav Barkai  

---

## 1. Workshop Introduction
- **Context & Motivation**  
  AI-powered coding tools (e.g. Claude Code) are becoming essential; adoption boosts productivity and future employability.  
- **Goals**  
  1. Hands-on experience with Claude Code  
  2. Best practices for integrating AI into daily development  

---

## 2. Agenda
1. Claude Code as a Development Tool  
2. Environment Setup (Git worktrees, CLI, IDE)  
3. Developing with Claude Code (CLI commands, `/init`, CLAUDE.md)  
4. Tools & MCP Servers (structured tool calls, Model Context Protocol)  
5. Best Practices (TnDDD, incremental cycles, docs)  
6. Common Workflows (PR review, debugging, feature dev)  

---

## 3. New Software Development Paradigm
- **Context-Aware AI Coding:** Leverage project context instead of isolated prompts  
- **Agent-Driven Development:** Treat Claude as a collaborative partner that can invoke tools autonomously  
- **Natural-Language Workflows:** Replace multi-step shell commands with conversational interfaces  
- **Directing vs. Writing:** Describe *what* you want; let the AI generate *how*  
- **Parallel Cycles:** Automate sub-tasks to run in parallel  

---

## 4. When to Use Claude Code
- **Ideal For:**  
  - Exploring unfamiliar codebases  
  - High-level design & documentation  
  - Enforcing standard patterns  
  - Automated testing & TDD  
- **Not Recommended:**  
  - 100% autopilot copy-paste coding  
  - Trivial one-line edits  
  - Large complex tasks without context prep  

---

## 5. Git Worktrees & Environment Setup
- **Git Worktrees:**  
  ```bash
  git worktree add <path> <branch>
````

Work in parallel branches via separate directories.

* **Installation & IDE Integration:**

  ```bash
  npm install -g @anthropic/claude-code
  ```

  Enable VSCode/IDE plugin for seamless CLI usage.
* **Key Env Vars:**

  * `ANTHROPIC_CLOUD_CODEC=1`
  * `DISABLE_PREFETCHING=0`
  * AWS credentials (`AWS_PROFILE`, `AWS_REGION`)
  * Cost-tracking helper (`ccui`)

---

## 6. Hands-On Exercises

1. Create a Git worktree for a feature/bug branch.
2. Install & configure Claude Code CLI.
3. Start a CC session in your project directory.
4. Use `/init` to scaffold `CLAUDE.md`.
5. Explore CLI commands (`/help`, `/tools`, `/switch_modes`).
6. List & use MCP servers (e.g. Playwright, Ruff/Pyright).
7. Define custom slash commands (lint & format hooks).
8. Add lifecycle hooks (e.g. post-task notifications).

---

## 7. Tools & the ToolUse Pattern

* **Tools:** JSON-defined functions for file ops, tests, searches, etc.
* **Pattern:**

  1. Claude receives tool schemas.
  2. Claude decides autonomously when to invoke.
  3. Results feed back into its reasoning stream.

---

## 8. Model Context Protocol (MCP)

* **Open Standard** for secure LLM ↔ external service integration.
* **Components:**

  * MCP Clients (Claude Code CLI)
  * MCP Servers (static analysis, browser, Jira, etc.)
* **Examples:**

  * `mcp-atlassian` for Jira
  * Playwright server for headless browser tasks
  * Static analysis (Ruff, Pyright)

---

## 9. Custom Commands & Hooks

* **Slash Commands:** Reusable Markdown prompts (project or personal).
* **Hooks:** Shell commands on lifecycle events (pre-commit, post-task).
* **Hands-On:**

  * Add a “task-finished” hook (e.g. console notification).
  * Create `/prepare-commit` to lint, format, analyze, summarize.

---

## 10. Plan Mode & Thinking Mode

* **Plan Mode** (`Shift+Tab+Tab`): Research & analysis only—no file edits or installs.
* **Thinking Mode:** Triggered by “think” for deeper, token-expensive reasoning.

---

## 11. Best Practices

* **Incremental Development:** Small, well-defined tasks; frequent commits.
* **TnDDD:** Tests & Documentation-Driven Development—write tests/docs *before* code.
* **Maintain `CLAUDE.md`:** Keep your workflow, commands, and hooks documented.
* **Parallelize Safely:** Use sub-agents for concurrent tasks when appropriate.
* **Cost Control:** Track prompts, reuse context, disable unnecessary prefetching.

---

## 12. Common Workflows

* **PR Review:** Automate diff summaries & improvement suggestions.
* **Bug Fixing & Debugging:** Rapid isolation & patch proposals.
* **Feature Development:** Scaffold modules and run TDD cycles.
* **Case Study:** DroxiFlow multi-agent orchestration demo in Python.
