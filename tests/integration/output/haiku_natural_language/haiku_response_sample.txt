VALIDATION DECISION: CONTINUE

The subagent has successfully completed the task objective. The deliverables demonstrate:

1. **Function Implementation**: An `add()` function has been created that accepts two parameters and returns their sum, directly addressing the core requirement.

2. **Input Validation**: The function includes validation to ensure both parameters are numbers, which is a quality enhancement beyond the minimal requirement and helps prevent runtime errors.

3. **Documentation**: Docstring documentation has been added, providing clear usage information and improving code maintainability.

The implementation is straightforward, functional, and includes best practices (validation and documentation). The task objective of creating a simple calculator function that adds two numbers has been fully met. The work is ready to proceed to the next phase if one exists.
